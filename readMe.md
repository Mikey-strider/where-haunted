# Where Haunted?

I wanted to create an app where I could find like minded people who ar into the paranormal and all things spooky.
I found that if I want to find people that think like me and are interested in the same intrests, I should build something.  


This app allows people to add edit delete and read other haunts people have placed into the app.  The are website lovations available as well. 

## MVP:
Basic, clean CRUD functionality within the app.  Be able to add haunts so people can see what experinces people had. Also be able to add reviews and read other peoples reviews along with authors name.  Nice styling with a fun **"ecto"** style color scheme. 


1. Create: A new haunt and add it to your profile.
2. Read: Other peoples haunts and see if they are some place you might want to check out.
3. Update: A specific haunt liek the name or description.
4. Delete: A haunt if you no longer want to have it on your site.



## Technologies Used:
 * HTML
 * CSS
 * javascript
 * Node.js
 * mongoDB
 * Express
 * Morgan



 ## Next Steps:
 * Adding a functioning rating system
 * Favoriting and unfavoriting haunts
 * User Profiles
 * Being able to view users favorites and reviews
